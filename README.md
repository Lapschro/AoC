** Advent of Code

Advent of code is a series of programming puzzles. You can find out more about it at [About Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about)

I will be using this repo to upload some solutions of older Advent of Code puzzles. I don't have interest on participating on the competition itself. But I am keen on doing the challenges so I don't get rusty on solving programming challenges. I'm currently using VS Code and Polyglot Notebooks extension to solve the puzzles using C#. Maybe in the future I will try solving them in other languages as well.
